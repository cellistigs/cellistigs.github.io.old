<ul>
<li>
download to pose_mats/models.  

<li>
Actually can't do this, we need the full model folder. 

<li>
When we tried to recreate, we were told that the project path and the video sets arguments were missing from configuration file. 

<li>
kick this back to johannes. 

<li>
Permissions issues: should have seen this coming. 

<ul>
<li class="done4">
Check with reviewer account (make sure it's okay with other analyses too!!)  #35313e59

<li class="done4">
download jh data locally  #2b775aef

<li class="done4">
check jh data and make training folders.  #f394bfa1

<li class="done4">
use admin permissions to make a test run.  #d86abfe1

<ul>
<li>
dataset: pose_mats/models/FearConditioningMSv4-JH-2021-07-08.zip

<li>
config: pose_mats/configs/train_dlc.yaml

<li>
submissions: pose_mats/submissions/jh_testsubmit.json

<li>
check on job w timestamp jh_test_training1:  

<li>
Conclusion: we are trying to create a training set, and require a conversion to another format with a user prompt. How can we get around the user prompt OR require the training data to be created already? The dlc2 script is not updated.  

</ul>
<li>
Editing: 

<ul>
<li class="done4">
remove the create a training set step.  #340e0c7d

<ul>
<li class="done4">
We set the windows2linux instead. .  #740f16ae

<li>
Now we know this works if you have the frames already (effectively overwriting the training.) 

<li class="done4">
What happens if we don't have them? (Johannes original data)  #f266b06b

<li>
A test dataset can have <code>create-training-dataset</code> have been run already, or it doesn't have to. both will work.  

</ul>
<li class="done4">
update neurocaas_contrib with dlc2 script  #94f58dad

<li class="done4">
run remotely.  #ab336373

<ul>
<li>
works in testing mode.  

</ul>
<li class="done4">
save instance  #e020e281

<li class="done4">
test again  #f6789e35

</ul>
