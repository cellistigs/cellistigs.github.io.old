<ul>
<li>
Preprocessing steps are big. 

<li>
each preprocessing each with specfici infra needs, need for stacks compatible with multiple. 

<li>
These can lead to an explosion of compatibility-based \iags issues that must be handled with care.

WFCI intro.

Protocol paper:

</ul>
<li>
Each depends on its own specialized infrastructure, and in combining them, users are vulnerable to compatibility iags.  

<li>
Compatibility iags can hurt \ncap too- we don't describe how we get around these issues. 

<li>
we don't talk about how it hurts \ncap in couto. 

<li>
Try: "To combat these issues, ncap enables a new way to efficiently run multi-component analyses. On ncap, existing infrastructure components hstoed on totally separate infrastructure stacks can be coupled together solely through their inputs and outputs \ref{fig:workflow}B." 

<li>
"These multi-component \iags issues are not fully addressed by \ncap as it has been described thus far." 

<li>
Protocol paper describes a full analysis (authority for why it's a good idea).  

<li>
We offer \ncap services as part of this.

<li>
Premise: multicomponent analyses invite their own \iags issues.  

<ul>
<li>
These issues come from interaction between components. 

<li>
Critically, these issues are as real on \ncap as they are for individual users. 

<li>
We describe the way in which we overcome these compatibility issues for multi-component pipelines.

Outline

<ul>
<li>
Requires a unique 

<li>
Big data is hard. 

<li>
Often analyzing big data is multi-step 

<li>
e.g.: WFCI. 

<li>
WFCI is big data.  

<li>
Protocol paper discusses complete analyses, and offers on \ncap. 

<li>
We use \ncap 

<li>
This complete analysi first involves data compression ..

<li>
Critically however, while both these cutting edge components are open source projects, they require infrastructure stacks with different components, inviting a variety of new \iags issues for researchers who wish to use them simultaneously.

<li>
While we discuss the generic benefits of \ncap, we don't describe the implementation that allows us to avoid these compatibility related \iags issues: 

<li>
In general, multi component analyses present new \iags issues due to the interaction between different infrastructure stacks- potential conflicts, slower updates, need for developer collaboration at the software implementation level. These issues are just as prominent when building a NeuroCAAS IAE as they are for any individuual user.   

<li>
Critically however, multi-component analyses require more 

<li>
* While both these analyses are available as open source projects, each depends on its own specialized infrastructure, and as such are vulnerable to all of the iags issues mentioned above.  

<li>
Users setting up multiple infrastructure stacks on a single machine. 

<ul>
<li>
"The task of setting up multiple overlapping infrastructure stacks involves many complications"

</ul>
<li>
However, to avoid these issues, ncap enables a totally new way to efficiently run multi-component analyses. On ncap, existing infrastructure components hstoed on totally separate infrastructure stacks can be coupled together solely through their inputs and outputs \ref{fig:workflow}B. 

<li>
Although we describe in terms of a protocol paper where we implemented this method, the general idea is independent of the actual IAE components.
