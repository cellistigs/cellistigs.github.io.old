BIG IDEA: Infrastructure is a fundamental part of any given data analysis. 

<ul>
<li>
Failing to specify infrastructure as a part of any scientific tool is no good. Leads to issues of reproducibility, actual analysis performance, accessibility, etc. 

<li>
How do we specify infrastructure as a part of data analysis in a functional way? IaC. 

</ul>
</ul>
<pre><code>
</pre></code>
<ul>
<li>
For each of the results: what science can you do now that you couldn't do before? 

<ul>
<li>
Loca: is there some nice benchmarking we can do here?  

<ul>
<li>
Consider the idea that you can register activity across different animals.  

</ul>
<li>
Parameter search? Look at robustness of analysis pipelines given parameters. Measure speed and accuracy of a given measure. 

<li>
PCS? PCS type results could be useful. Calculate stability scores w.r.t. some experimental result. What is the stability of the idea that different brain regions are involved in a task for example? 

<li>
Talk to john about this. 

</ul>
<li>
Consider simplifying the argument. 

<ul>
<li>
IaGS is an issue about reproducibility.  

<li>
The scale/accessibility tradeoff is an artificial issue introduced through existing platforms. 

<li>
NeuroCAAS results 1 is reproducibility. 

<li>
NeuroCAAS result 2 is breaking the scale/accessibility tradeoff: i.e. not being like these other platforms.

The Intro IaC paragraph through 3.1 needs work ; still a little vague and unclear what exactly we are talking about. The lack of clarity is the same lack that makes cloud stuff so hard to talk about in the first place. really ground this in the language you set up in the first half of the intro: infrastructure; what is an infrastructure stack, etc. .
