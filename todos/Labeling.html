For a labeling job, it's extremely helpful to look at the Javascript source code in the labeling GUI. In this case, we found that there was an issue with the CORS configuration of the bucket "label-job-create-web"- the CORS configuration of the bucket seems to have prevented the labeling GUI from pulling in data. This is strange because it looks like the labeling gui was able to successfully start jobs from here several times, so it's unclear why this was an issue.
