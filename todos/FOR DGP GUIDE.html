IMPORTANT: if model is trained, will not be retrained. just runs prediction. 

<li>
IMPORTANT: takes the first TrainingFraction argument. 

<li>
MPORTANT: video_sets should be given as relative paths to the config.yaml file path. i.e. videos/

Addendum: assume that videos are given in the videos file, we will take the basename and rewrite the whole path. .

IMPORTANT: dgp will predict on videos in videos_dgp unless none exist. in that case, it will predict on videos in cfg["video_sets"].

IMPORTANT: Allowed types are avi, mp4, mov, mkv

1. make test data. two different model folders, of which each have trained and untrained versions. <span class="todo">DONE</span>

<ul>
<li>
The only difference between trained and untrained looks to be the contents of dlc-models/iteration-0/taskname/train/ 

<li>
Issue: the name prefixing the model folder is important. restore these. Changed source code instead. 

<li>
right now: demo writes into the current folder, not the videos_pred folder. Fixed

<li>
pretty sure the zip is not replacing. it is, but maybe not deleting.

IMPORTANT: if model is trained, will not be retrained. just runs prediction. 

<li>
dgp code does not replace model files generally either. fixed with update_configs_general function.

DLCPATH was treated as a global variable from argparse??! recheeck run too.

ISSUE: permissions issue now when running sudo -i! very weird error.
