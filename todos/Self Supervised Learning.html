<p>
The defining feature of self supervised learning is that you're going to learn a good representation of the data by looking at some aspect of your own training.

<p>
In the case of Oord et al. 2019 (Contrastive Predictive Coding) you do this by means of <span id="Self Supervised Learning-InfoNCE-negative samples"></span><strong id="negative samples">negative samples</strong> in the context of sequential data: given some sequence data,  
we try to learn a good representation of the data by: 
</p>

<ul>
<li>
1. Forming a per-timepoint (or more coarse) representation of the data using an encoder model (\(z_t\))

<li>
2. Transforming the per-timepoint representation with an autoregressive model (\(c_t\)) 

<li>
3. Estimating the unnormalized likelihood of future sequence data based on a bilinear form (\(c_t^TW_{t+k}z_{t+k}\))   

<li>
4. Optimizing this estimate. This is essentially a classification task that asks networks to correctly identify the data at a certain point in the future given a latent representation of the present and latent representations of the future.

<li>
5. By doing so, one can learn latent representations of the data and a long term context that capture some information about the future of this data. 

</ul>
