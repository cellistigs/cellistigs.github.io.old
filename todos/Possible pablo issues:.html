<li>
auto generated permissions don't have list access to the full bucket? see if you might need to change this.  #464366c0

<ul>
<li>
if s3_ls is only used once, be prepared to replace bucket.objects.all with bucket.objects.filter(username) 

</ul>
<li>
doesn't work for userfolders not in churchland group?  

<li>
Record:

<ul>
<li>
1. you went into the development instance, and changed the profile.html's final field from iam.data_bucket to iam.group.name

<li>
2. you then ran <code>python manage.py runserver</code>, <code>python manage.py migrate</code> <code>python manage.py staticcollection</code>, and saw how html changes to profile.html were propagated with each of these changes. 

<ul>
<li>
It appears that making html edits actually propagates through regardless of any of these things. 

</ul>
<li>
3. you then went into the production instance, and just changed the profile.html file. 

<li>
4. updated the buckets to filter with group and subfolder prefix. 

</ul>
<li>
Reminding ourselves how this bucket works. 

<ul>
<li>
1. submissions go to subdirectories of the inputs bucket. we expect the inputs to be contained in a folder inputs/datafolder/, where the inputs are yet to be submitted. 

<li>
2. this should work fine, as we made sure to keep it as is. 

<li>
3. The issue with joao could then be budget, but where is the budget being written to? 

<ul>
<li>
There doesn't appear to be an issue witih ChurchlandGroup. 

</ul>
<li>
The issue is that there is no upload capacity from other folders atm because the blueprint does not expect those other folders. 

<li>
How can we solve this? 

<ul>
<li>
What can't we change?  

<li>
Right now, users already exist in this bucket, and they have upload permissions to inputs and download permissions from results. so that's fine. 

<li>
The bucket itself has permissions to submit only from churchland group. We need to relax this trigger. 

<li>
It should be sufficient to just update the pipeline to "WebSubstack" mode and redeploy.  

<ul>
<li>
What is different? 

<ul>
<li>
The existing blueprint is currently in "webdev" mode (not creating users, just adding) This means that the submission triggers that it has are tied to individual user groups. 

<li>
bucket layout. This is dictated by the lambda function and the AMI. 

<li>
permissions. This is dictated by the blueprint itself. 

<li>


</ul>
</ul>
</ul>
</ul>
<li class="done4">
Make sure that updating an existing stack will not trigger issues with the existing user substacks.  #2372c48d

<ul>
<li>
We have version control on! 

</ul>
