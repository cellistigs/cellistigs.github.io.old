Probably the most relevant article type for you will be the NeuroResource. The Neuron website specifies the goals of NeuroResources as follows: 

<ul>
<li>
NeuroResources provide a forum for presentation of cutting-edge technology, methods, and resources that open new avenues for experimental investigation of important neurobiological questions. NeuroResources explain the experimental objectives, protocol, and limitations of current techniques while providing some "proof of principle" demonstration of the power of the new technique or method. Major informational databases propose a new biological insight derived from the data set.

</ul>
<li>
This might be a good forum through which to appeal directly to the pragmatic side of computational neuroscience and its interface with the biological part of the field. 

<li>
Note that there are not distinct submission guidelines for the NeuroResource as an independent publication listed on the Neuron Page. However, guidelines for all Neuron papers are given here:
