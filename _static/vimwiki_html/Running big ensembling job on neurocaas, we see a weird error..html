<ul>
<li>
Job ids: job__ensemble-dgp_dgptest_5_seed{}, job__ensemble-dgp_dgptest_17_seed{}, where seeds are 2,7,12,17,22,27,32,37,42,52 

<li>
Group name: debuggers. 

<li>
The five frame jobs beyond seed 12 say the job was halted by the budget, but they have continued on anyway. . 

<li>
Many of the 17 frame jobs also claim to have been halted by the system.  

<li>
SOLUTION: You were looking at certificates and configs from different jobs. There is one set of jobs from 17:43, and another from 17:47? 

<ul>
<li>
It looks like some at least had certificates updates 7 minutes later, and others did not. Is this bc of lambda retries? 

</ul>
<li>
They continued onwards, with the correct command, and did not have to be halted by the system. (checked with cloudwatch logs: <a href="https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/home?region=us-east-1#logsV2:log-groups/log-group/">https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/home?region=us-east-1#logsV2:log-groups/log-group/</a>\(252Faws\)252Flambda\(252Fec2-rogue-killer/log-events/2021\)252F07\(252F18\)252F\(255B\)2524LATEST$255Dee149722d3954f2cb1fa68b48948765d)

<li>
FOR FUTURE: We could address this by making the timestamp for each job more relevant, and by reducing the lambda retries. 

<ul>
<li>
Reducing lambda retries is a bad idea bc it can help us with long jobs. 

</ul>
</ul>
