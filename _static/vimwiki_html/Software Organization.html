<p>
There are four repos associated with NeuroCAAS. 
</p>

<ul>
<li>
neurocaas: The main, IaC repo that corresponds to the platform that we built. 

<li>
neurocaas-contrib: The developer package for those who want to contribute analyses to NeuroCAAS

<li>
neurocaas-frontend: Django based code for the website frontend to NeuroCAAS

<li>
neurocaas-interface: (prototype) Code for general purpose GUI/source code based development. 

</ul>
<p>
Assume you are a user of the website. Then, you don't need to worry about any of these. 
Assume you are a python based user. Then, you should get neurocaas-interface. 
Assume you are a developer who wants to contribute a new analysis. You should pip install neurocaas-contrib and fork neurocaas.
Assume you are a developer who wants to contribute a new analysis, and build a GUI. You should pip install neurocaas-contrib, reference neurocaas-interface and fork neurocaas.
Assume you are a developer who wants to contribute a new analysis, and or integrate NeuroCAAS into their workflow. You should pip install neurocaas-contrib, reference neurocaas-interface and fork neurocaas.
</p>

<p>
NeuroCAAS contrib as a repo will also have nice documentation and guides, but should not have a whole separate blueprint repository. Link your neurocaas-contrib to the neurocaas repo upon install.
