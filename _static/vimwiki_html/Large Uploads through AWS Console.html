<p>
When uploading large datasets to NeuroCAAS, you may experience difficulties through the native website interface. In particular, some users have experienced difficulties with datasets greater than 2 GB. To provide a fast and easy solution to this issue, we provide an alternative upload option with optimized upload times through the Amazon Web Services (AWS) console. 
</p>

<div id="Managing Large Uploads with the AWS console-Step 1: Getting Credentials"><h2 id="Step 1: Getting Credentials" class="header"><a href="#Managing Large Uploads with the AWS console-Step 1: Getting Credentials">Step 1: Getting Credentials</a></h2></div>
<p>
To get started, you will need: 
</p>
<ol>
<li>
the data you want to upload

<li>
AWS Credentials. 

</ol>
<p>
You can get AWS credentials in your account profile (click your name on the website):  
</p>

<p>

</p>

<p>
Then note your AWS User Name and AWS Password. You will be prompted for these credentials later on. 
</p>

</p>

<div id="Managing Large Uploads with the AWS console-Step 2: Logging in to AWS"><h2 id="Step 2: Logging in to AWS" class="header"><a href="#Managing Large Uploads with the AWS console-Step 2: Logging in to AWS">Step 2: Logging in to AWS</a></h2></div>
<p>
Next, we will login to AWS. You can access AWS through the link at the bottom of each analysis page: 
</p>

<p>
<a href="/Users/taigaabe/neurocaas/media/awsloginwalkthrough/awsloginstep2.png">file:~/neurocaas/media/awsloginwalkthrough/awsloginstep2.png</a>
</p>

<p>
This will take you to the AWS login page. On this first page, make sure to click "IAM user" instead of "Root user", and enter "neurocaas" in the Account ID box:
</p>

<p>
<a href="/Users/taigaabe/neurocaas/media/awsloginwalkthrough/awsloginstep3.png">file:~/neurocaas/media/awsloginwalkthrough/awsloginstep3.png</a>
</p>

<p>
Finally, you will be asked to enter an IAM user name and Password for the NeuroCAAS account. Enter the AWS User Name and AWS Password here from your account profile: 
</p>

<p>
<a href="/Users/taigaabe/neurocaas/media/awsloginwalkthrough/awsloginstep4.png">file:~/neurocaas/media/awsloginwalkthrough/awsloginstep4.png</a>
</p>

<div id="Managing Large Uploads with the AWS console-Step 3: Uploading Data"><h2 id="Step 3: Uploading Data" class="header"><a href="#Managing Large Uploads with the AWS console-Step 3: Uploading Data">Step 3: Uploading Data</a></h2></div>
<p>
Now, you should see a page that says "Amazon S3". You will be dropped into a folder that represents your personal data storage for the particular analysis page that you logged in through. Note that you can also freely upload, organize and delete data here, but you will not be able to download input data back to yourself, access to any other user data, or any other features of AWS. Go ahead and drag and drop the data you want to upload onto the page: 
</p>

<p>
<a href="/Users/taigaabe/neurocaas/media/awsloginwalkthrough/awsloginstep5.png">file:~/neurocaas/media/awsloginwalkthrough/awsloginstep5.png</a>
</p>

<p>
You will then be taken to a summary page where you will be asked to confirm the upload that you started (total number of files, file size, etc.). If everything looks good, click the orange Upload button:
</p>

<p>
<a href="/Users/taigaabe/neurocaas/media/awsloginwalkthrough/awsloginstep6.png">file:~/neurocaas/media/awsloginwalkthrough/awsloginstep6.png</a>
</p>

<p>
The file will then begin uploading. Note that you should not interrupt the internet connection (putting your computer to sleep, for example) while this is going on, as it will cause the upload to fail. 
</p>

<p>
<a href="/Users/taigaabe/neurocaas/media/awsloginwalkthrough/awsloginstep7.png">file:~/neurocaas/media/awsloginwalkthrough/awsloginstep7.png</a>
</p>

<p>
Once the upload has succeeded, you will see the new data in the page. Once you go back to the NeuroCAAS page, you will see your data there as well, ready to be analyzed in jobs.
