Some thoughts from putting together a personal website and trying to host your todos on it.

Gotchas:

<ul>
<li>
when using sphinx/ablog, you can't nest files arbitrarily with the raw directive and expect to have them compile correctly. In particular, it looks like anything not in the top level directory with index.html will not appear. In fact sometimes even having index.html doesnt work right when you push to the real site! All in all, this is a whole other ballgame.  

<li>
however, you can do some nice things like set up your conf.py file with code that lists directories, and uses that to generate rst files on the fly for example (see conf.py for a commented out example at the very top). This has the potential for a lot of flexibility if you end up figuring out the right way to structure raw html as part of a sphinx project.
