These issues could be handled by the tests that are failing right now in the neurocaasami branch. treat them there.  #a751e218

<li class="done4">
I have a blueprint in my repo, and when I run get-blueprint, it prints this blueprint. However, the actual jobs are deployed from the develop-dict that is being used to initialize the AMI state in .neurocaas_contrib_config.json. This is bad because you can't tell where your job is deploying from!  #0b969ca9

<li class="done4">
BIG: this issue fundamentally comes down tol I'm working ,and I need  to change the blueprint command. How do I do that?  #33260406

<li class="done4">
BIG: when I terminate an instance, that should clear the develop_hist field in your state command.  #313a787a

<li class="done4">
When I update an existing blueprint, the template has only one user. Overwriting the users existing in a template already is catastrophic!  #6bccec29

<li>
Current workflow:

<ul>
<li>
1. I run neurocaas-contrib remote start-session

<ul>
<li>
there is never a develop-history, because I don't save it. So, we initialize the develop_dict in the cli config from scratch. This is not a problem because we only run it once we want to flush.   

<li>
update-history goes basically unused because we don't call it. So, the development history exists only in the .contrib_config file. This seems fine.  

</ul>
</ul>
<li class="done4">
Proposed workflow:  #10bb0beb

<ul>
<li>
1. delete the update-history function. history tracking can happen through ami updates 

<ul>
<li class="done4">
make the git committing more robust.  #2e134f3f

</ul>
<li class="done4">
2. rename develop-remote to start-session. This will look to see if you are developing something else (i.e. if init matches contents), and clean up relevant instances.  #f7fdfb26

<li class="done4">
3. create method end-session. This method will check your current file contents, and delete all instances contained within.  #a84c4649

</ul>
