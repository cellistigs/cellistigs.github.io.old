Both Mats + Methods and Supplementary Materials are very redundant. Go paragraph by paragraph here: 

<li>
5. Materials and methods. 

<ul>
<li>
5.1 NeuroCAAS architecture specifics.

<ul>
<li>
1. All of neurocaas is actually managed via iac. This is called a code schematic; code schematics contain protocols and are lambda.. 

<li>
2. Another part of the code schematic is a user profile (we don't introduce the term user profile); security info. website automates fill in. other code schematic parts are available at repo. 

<li>
3. Deployment: NeuroCAAS contains tools to deploy itself. There is total coverage of the NeuroCAAS platform from code schematic (redundant with para 1.) <span id="-replace paragraph 1 with this"></span><strong id="replace paragraph 1 with this">replace paragraph 1 with this</strong>

<li>
4. What's not managed via iac? website. If people want to deploy their own interface, they can do so. All they have to worry about is data storage. 

<li>
5. The website will give them creds if they want; groups for users works too; wfield does this, iac deployment of <span id="-user profiles"></span><strong id="user profiles">user profiles</strong> (definition here) , created with IaM.  

<li>
5.1.1: Deploying analyses from blueprints.

<ul>
<li>
1. blueprints are custom built JSON objects; we describe neurocaas component functions; blueprints list users; example in supplement. 

<li>
2. Deployment of a blueprints only creates a persistent job manager, not anything else. Then iaes and infrastructrues are user triggered. Job managers could pre-schedule in the future. Job managers can do multiple, <span id="-weak coupling to word protocol"></span><strong id="weak coupling to word protocol">weak coupling to word protocol</strong>

<li>
3. IAE and resource bank: IAE is a vm; etc; . 

<ul>
<li>
4. Resource bank is an instance; instance type details. 

</ul>
<li>
5. Blueprint is a line of code: changes are auto logged to version control, job id- we don't mention contrib package. 

<li>
6. Collected blueprints in a version controlled repo (source repo)

</ul>

Reorganized 5:

5.1 NeuroCAAS architecture specifics:

<ul>
<li>
1. Most of neurocaas is actually managed via iac, in a single source repo. In the Platform section, we gave an overview of the constituent parts of a single analysis. We go a little more in depth here, and discuss two aspects that can be described in further depth: 1. Protocols, and 2. User profiles (current point 5.). 

<li>
The parts that arent are the website (and other interfaces) and the contribution package. These interact with the source repository, and help users fill in user profiles/analysis blueprints respectively.  

<li>
<span id="-All the stuff about deployment should go in the next section."></span><strong id="All the stuff about deployment should go in the next section.">All the stuff about deployment should go in the next section.</strong>

<li>
From 5.1.1; blueprint version control and change logging should go in the first section (5.1.1, section 5 + 6 )

<li>
5.1.1: 

<ul>
<li>
5.1, point 3; point 5 (user profile deployment). 

<li>
5.1.1: user profile deployment creates storage; that's all that other interfaces have to worry about (5.1 point 4)

<li>
Contrib tools also help deploy stuff independently of job manager protocols. 

</ul>
</ul>
</ul>
<li>
Reorganized 5.1 looks nice to me. I don't think it merits a separate 5.1.1 for deployment: fold whatever you want to say about deployment into 5.1  

<ul>

What do you want to say about deployment anyway? Evaluate points below and determine what you want to incorporate  #15b0b8b2

<li class="done4">
Versioning with the neurocaas-contrib tool ("Finally, since each blueprint is ...")  #8a097109

<li>
The fact that stacks are transient but job managers are forever.  #1d11d2ba

IaC deployment of user profiles gives IAM resources.  #c866f855
