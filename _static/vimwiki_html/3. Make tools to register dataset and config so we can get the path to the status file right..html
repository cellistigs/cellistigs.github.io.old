Important issue: where does downloading and uploading happen? 

<ul>
<li>
if it happens in the main script, then we need to somehow pass the knowledge of where everything is stored to the script $5 

<li>
if it happens in the child script, then we need to pass the full paths [currently doing]. 

<ul>
<li>
Goals:  

<ul>
<li>
backwards compatibility: I should be able to replace existing scripts with a formula. 

<li>
ease of running for dev mode: I shouldn't have to rerun from main if data is already in place. 

</ul>
<li>
Plan: 

<ul>
<li>
make this a single object called scriptmanager. Initialize to io-dir location .

<ul>
<li>
register-dataset, register-results 

</ul>
<li>
register in the main script. Registration makes several different things possible: 

<li>
1. call get-xxxname, get-xxxpath to get environment variables pointing to those items and their paths.  

<ul>
<li>
coordinate so that the location these are saved to matches to volumes docker expects: should be called io-dir, and have configs, inputs, logs, results folders setup... The logs folder here should be given to the scripting/log_process file. 

</ul>
<li>
2. call get-xxx to actually retrieve the relevant files from s3. have flag for skip if already exists.  

<li>
cleanup-script should deregister. 

</ul>
</ul>
</ul>
<li>
This also paves the way to auto-download of datasets. 

<li>
The vision now is that we have a bash script that's all neurocaas_contrib scripting functions. 

<ul>
<li>
register_dataset and register_config files will download files, and give paths to the datasets and locations. 

<li>
run_analysis will then log in the background and run a script. 

<li>
finally, clean up will delete datasets, finish logging, send end.txt etc. . 

</ul>
</ul>
