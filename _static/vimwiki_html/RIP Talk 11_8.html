Time til talk: 11 weeks. 
Time til end of active work: 8.5 weeks
</p>

<p>
No matter what, by october 18th you should be done with new work. 
</p>

<p>
We have 8 weeks to put together the materials we need to make a great presentation for RIP talk. 
</p>

<p>
What should your rip talk cover? 
As much of everything as makes sense in a continuous context. 
</p>

<p>
In particular, let’s go after this self-supervised learning aspect. SSL plus ensembing. 
</p>

<p>
Plan A: (Ideal)
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Show that self supervised techniques with the data itself are useful for better estimates of marker points and uncertainty due to ensembling. Extension into other training sets, intermediate use of model zoo architectures, show improvements in performance and confidence estimates across different train/test splits. 

<li>
The story is separating out task and domain expertise for scientific machine learning tasks. 

<li>
This story is supported by infrastructure from the NeuroCAAS project. Running more jobs for RIP talk seems reasonable to me, ask JPC to make sure in three weeks.

</ul>
<p>
Plan B: (Contingency)
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Tell the story of NeuroCAAS one more time. Include things like the labeling job, the cli, and add more pipelines/ workflows to fill out the story. 

<li>
In particular, go back to the widefield work and flesh out that story some more. Add fleshed out ensembling to the story and focus on these two applications as examples of how more infrastructure can dramatically help. 

<li>
Try and get some examples of real time thrown in there as well. 

</ul>
<p>
Other things to keep in mind: 
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Labor Day weekend trip (- 1 week)

<li>
Probable NeuroCAAS reviews back. 

<ul>
<li>
If reviews are workable, you’ll probably lose some time (2-4 weeks or so). In this case, Plan B probably makes more sense as you’ll have to do this work anyway  

<li>
If reviews are negative, you should still spend 1-2 weeks on a rebuttal if possible. Plan A or B open 

<li>
If reviews close the door, I’d like to spend 1-2 weeks at most revising for resubmission over this period. Plan A or B open.  

</ul>
</ul>
<p>
Overall, this means you have something more like 4-6 weeks total of real work to make this come together. 
</p>

<p>
How should we spend these weeks? 
</p>

<p>
Plan A: 
Week 1: (this week)
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Baseline SSL network against Imagenet supervised pretraining network 

<li>
Initial SSL results with Two Mouse Data. 

</ul>
<p>
Week 2:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Refine SSL paradigm and compare against at least one more. 

<li>
Have a rough SSL pipeline that you can start pushing mice through. 

<ul>
<li>
Weight conversion/formatting

</ul>
</ul>
<p>
Week 3: 
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Estimate uncertainty with SSL ensembles pretrained on data itself. How does this compare against uncertainty for ensembles pretrained on imagenet? 

</ul>
<p>
Week 4: 
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Extension to other training sets: Betta Fish (make gt data) ibl mouse data. 

</ul>
<p>
Week 5: (Stretch)
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Iterating across a growing dataset, scaling to large datasets. 

</ul>
<p>
Week 6: (Stretch)
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Intermediate ssl step with model zoo type data

</ul>
<p>
Plan B: 
Week 1:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Wfield. Implement parallelism, look at Joao’s thalamus data and do parameter search. 

</ul>
<p>
Week 2: 
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Cli. Labeling job refinement, make ready to include for active learning. If we get rejected, talk about getting Nick on board for paper. 

</ul>
<p>
Week 3:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Flesh out ensembling story to a good stopping point. 

</ul>
<p>
Week 4: 
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Relic/Real time things we can add to show off. 

</ul>
