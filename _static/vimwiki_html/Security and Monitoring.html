Now, developer usage (and some deployment usage) is switched to a tag based workflow, where ec2 instances are launched with specific tags that identify the amount of time they are allowed to be active. Here is the current layout:
</p>

<ul>
<li>
"Soft cap" protections on general usage:

<ul>
<li>
test-ec2-killer (SNS: NeuroCAAS EC2 General Monitor)

</ul>
</ul>
<pre><code>
Kills all ec2 instances that are not on an explicit exempt list after 720 minutes (12 hours) of activity. Generates email and text message alerts in case of aberrant behavior. 
</code></pre>

<ul>
<li>
ec2-rogue-killer (SNS: NeuroCAAS EC2 Rogue Monitor)

</ul>
<pre><code>Kills all ec2 instances that are not on ssm, or explicitly provided with a timeout after 15 minutes of activity. Generates email and text message alerts. 
</code></pre>

<ul>
<li>
“Hard cap functions” on NeuroCAAS triggered usage. 

<ul>
<li>
neurocaas-guardduty-develop (SNS: NeuroCAAS EC2 Development Group Monitor)
    Stops all ec2 instances that have the developer security group after 2880 minutes of activity (2 days). Generates email alerts 

<li>
neurocaas-guardduty-deploy (SNS: NeuroCAAS EC2 Deployment Group Monitor)
    Stops all ec2 instances that have the deploy security group after 120 minutes of activity. Generates email and text message alerts. 

</ul>
<li>
Billing alert: Alert in case costs exceed a specifed threshold monthly budget. Generates email and text message alerts. 

</ul>
<p>
These functions provide a nice layer of security against unexpected usage in all cases except a ssm job that continues unnecessarily.
</p>

<p>
Here are the next steps:
</p>

<ul>
<li class="done0">
Use the timeout tag in ssm timeouts as well, for redundancy

<li class="done0">
Reference ownership tags in the lambda startup script to find currently active instances when calculating budget.

<li class="done0">
Include the current request load of instances with given timeout when calculating budget.

<li class="done0">
Build the corresponding monitoring lambda function guard and add as an additional soft cap to those above.

<li class="done0">
Generate messages back to the user if we have to kill a deployment instance with a clear description of what went wrong.

<li class="done0">
Use pr workflow to vet analyses and bring them into tag based workflow.

</ul>
