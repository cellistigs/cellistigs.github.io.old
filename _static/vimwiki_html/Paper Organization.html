Paper organization is a way for you to structure your knowledge so that it's easier to search and more efficient to recall. 
What do you know about how your brain works w.r.t. papers? 
</p>
<ul>
<li>
It's way more fun to read papers as hard copies. 

<li>
It's way easier to search and find papers online. 

<li>
If you read a paper and find it interesting, you can recover the topic/gap with prompting in discussion up to a month later (about). 

<li>
In general, you don't read enough literature before starting/deciding what to do next. 

<li>
If you were to read 5 papers per week, you would be much happier with your understanding of knowledge, even if it's review. 

</ul>
<p>
End goal workflow:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Whenever you run into a new paper, upload it to your to read list in papers with the todo tag and appropriate list tags.

<li>
Ideally work through enough papers that this list is has approximate net length. 

<li>
Upload the ref for new papers to anki, and link to the blog post that you've written/plan to write. 

<li>
Whenever you read a paper, write a short summary, and then post the summary plus link to papers version to a github blog. Link to other related papers.
