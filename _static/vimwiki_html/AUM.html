misclassification Geoff  #7186318d

<ul>
<li>
Very cool paper with code package available. Identifying potentially mislabeled data will be a big step.  

<li>
Some applications to your work directly: 

<ul>
<li>
Take a patch around each animal's id center, and do three class classification as dam, virgin, or other 

<li>
Take a patch around each part of each animal, and do 2*p+1 class classification as parts or other. 

<li class="done4">
Look at AUM package  #38652978

<ul>
<li>
looks very easy to use 

</ul>
<li class="done4">
Train a simple classifier and try this in pytorch!  #42a9414b

<li class="done0">
Nominally works. Try with a larger network + pretraining.  #5aba1462

Meeting Notes: Geoff and Matt 

<ul>
<li>
Accentuate stochasticity: small batch, high learning rate is better. 

<li>
Image classification is best forum. 

<li>
Failure case: textual data classification: subjective labels, multi-label, where it's not necessarily clear how to apply.  

<li>
Threshold samples are not what Geoff is happiest with 

<ul>
<li>
XValidation instead? It's more expensive, but nice. 

</ul>
<li>
Robust to choice of base metric (i.e. margin)  

<ul>
<li>
RMSE loss might be fine to use instead! 

<li>
the key is Averaging 

<li>
20 is okay, 50 is better (for averaging )

</ul>
<li>
Curriculum learning: 

<ul>
<li>
What neural networks memorize and why 

<li>
<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.03703">https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.03703</a>

<ul>
<li>
Is there a relationship between influence functions and AUM ranking? 

</ul>
<li>
When bad networks get memorized right away, it's hard to come back. 

<li>
Research question: how much do early bad examples influence your training?  

</ul>
<li>
An experiment: how do you apply classification models to pose estimation? 

<ul>
<li>
create a 9x9 grid out of mnist 

<li>
The task is to locate each digit at every point in time.  

<li>
how does aum ranking on mnist relate? 

<li>
What is this experiment for? hard to say right now.

</ul>
