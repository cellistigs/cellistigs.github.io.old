   You can adapt this file completely to your liking, but it should at least
   contain the root `toctree` directive.

Welcome to Taiga Abe's Blog!
============================================

Hello World! Find more about me here: :ref:`about`

The posts on this page will be divided in to literature summaries, research insights, and documentation of ongoing projects. 
You can find the most recent examples of each category here: 

Literature: 

.. postlist:: 5
   :category: Lit

Research: 

.. postlist:: 5
   :category: Res

Documentation: 

.. postlist:: 5
   :category: Doc


.. `toctree` directive, below, contains list of non-post `.rst` files.
   This is how they appear in Navigation sidebar. Note that directive
   also contains `:hidden:` option so that it is not included inside the page.

   Posts are excluded from this directive so that they aren't double listed
   in the sidebar both under Navigation and Recent Posts.
