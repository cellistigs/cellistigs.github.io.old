About Taiga Abe
============================
I am currently a Graduate Student in the Columbia Neurobiology and Behavior program. 
My advisor is John Cunningham, and I work closely with the Paninski group as well. 
My research interests include statistical machine learning, social behavior, motor control and the computing infrastructure necessary to support research in these topics.  
I'm also an avid rock climber and formerly avid cellist.
