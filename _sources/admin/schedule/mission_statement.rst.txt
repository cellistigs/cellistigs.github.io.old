Mission Statement
================= 

* Continually find and renew sources of inspiration. 
* Live a writerly life: observe yourself intently, and become an expert on your own interests and strengths, as well as your shames and weaknesses. Do not let yourself turn away from your inner reality. 
* Be the cellist in the quartet: provide a foundation for others, ground the harmony and don't be afraid to take the lead when it matters most. 
* Guide yourself by your values, not your talents. Just because you can be intelligent and empathetic does not mean that you always need to prove that to yourself or others. Focus on the biggest picture. 
* Avoid situations that make you feel trapped, and avoid putting others in those situations as well. Do favors to your future self.
    * Make decisions from a place of self awareness and balance, not stress and reaction.
